    "### Physics simulation of ball and its application using 3D ball tracking data\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years the development of football analytics has been growing rapidly especially in the field of tracking data. Given Skillcorner data with 3D ball tracking data, we can use a Physics informed model to simulate the ball's trajectory and how ball data enables us to understand the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all given noisy nature of data, we first clean the data to make it more reliable. There are few steps to clean the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter out high pass only as friction is ground pass would affect the ball's trajectory and air pass would be simpler to simulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clean up initial and final positions of the ball to filter out the outliers that start or end too high.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using second derivative of z-coordinate to detect parabolic landing points so it filter out portions of ball trajectory that are after touching the ground.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Use 30 degree cone to filter out the ball trajectory that is not in the same direction as the initial velocity vector to filter out pass that take a sharp turn.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is are few of trajectories after cleaning:\n",

    "#### Prediction of Ball's Landing Position\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning the data we can train a XGBoost model to predict the ball's landing position and number of frames to target as given the noise of the pass segment, it gives us a good estimate of the ball's landing position and hence estimate of ball velocity. Here is the model result which shows a pretty good fit to the data.\n",

    "#### Physics Simulation of Ball's Trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "Now given the ball's landing position and velocity, we can use a physics engine to simulate the ball's trajectory. This work adapt Professor Alan Nathan's model https://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/trajectory-calculator-new.html and turn the relevant equations into python code. On transforming to football we need to change the dimension of the ball, but also given the pass segment calculated before, we can fit the data can calculate the appropriate drag coefficient which fit to be about 60% of baseball. It also correlate well in data which MLB baseball has a drag coefficient of ~0.34 and various football used in World Cup has a drag coefficient of ~0.23.

    "Here is one of sample pass fit with the drag coefficient:\n",

    "\n",
    "Moreover, given the Physicaal simulation of the ball's trajectory, we can visualize it and for example how player should alter the shooting speed, angle and spin in order to score a goal and code can be found in src/field.htm in submission. Here is a sample visualization in 1st and 3rd person view:\n",

    "#### Prediction of Player's Trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using the ball location and position of players we can predict trajectory of the players throughout the pass. Using a similar model to top performing public model in NFL Big Data Bowl 2026, we can predict the player's trajectory with a good accuracy. Here is the result the predicted vs actual trajectory:\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we show that combining 3D ball tracking data with machine learning and physics can give a realistic simulation of football passes. After carefully cleaning the noisy tracking data and focusing on air passes, we are able to extract ball trajectories that can be well explained by physical models. This cleaning step is essential, as it directly affects the quality of both the learned model and the physics simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost model provides a robust estimate of the ball’s landing position and flight duration, which allows us to infer the initial velocity of the pass. Using these estimates, we adapt an existing physics-based ball flight model to football and fit an appropriate drag coefficient. The resulting value aligns well with reported measurements in the literature, giving confidence that the model captures meaningful aerodynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the physics-based simulation enables intuitive visualization of ball trajectories and can be extended to analyze shooting decisions and player movement during passes. Overall, this approach demonstrates how physics-informed modeling can complement tracking data to better understand ball dynamics and player behavior in football.\n",
